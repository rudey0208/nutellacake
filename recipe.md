# INSTRUCTIONS
## Chocolate Cake:
* Preheat oven to 350F, grease three 6" round baking pans and dust with cocoa powder. Line bottoms with parchment.
* Place all dry ingredients into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Stir to combine.
* In a medium bowl whisk all wet ingredients (pour water in slowly as not to cook the eggs if very hot).
* Add wet ingredients to dry and mix on medium for 2-3 mins. Batter will be very thin.
* Pour evenly into prepared pans. I used a kitchen scale to ensure the batter is evenly distributed.
* Bake until a cake tester comes out mostly clean. A total of 35-40mins.
* Cool 10 minutes in the pans then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
## Nutella Swiss Meringue Buttercream:
* Place egg whites and sugar into the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk until combined.*
* Place bowl over a hot water bath on the stove and whisk constantly until the mixture is hot and no longer grainy to the touch (approx. 3mins). Or registers 160F on a candy thermometer.
* Place bowl on your stand mixer and whisk on med-high until the meringue is stiff and cooled (the bowl is no longer warm to the touch (approx. 5-10mins)).
* Switch to paddle attachment. Slowly add cubed butter and mix until smooth and fluffy.** Add Nutella and mix until incorporated and buttercream is smooth and fluffy.
## assembly
* Cut each layer of cake in half horizontally to create 6 total layers.
* Place one layer of cake on a cake stand or serving dish. Top with about 1/2 cup buttercream. Drizzle with some of the ganache (1-2Tbsp).*** Sprinkle chopped hazelnuts on top (optional). Repeat with remaining layers. Frost and smooth the outside with a thin crumb coat. Chill for 20mins.
* Frost and smooth the outside of the cake, generously frosting the sides specifically. Smooth with an icing smoother. Use a cake comb on the sides of the cake. Repeat, scraping off more frosting each time, until smooth.
